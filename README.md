Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The objective of the course project was to write a script that would collect, clean, and tidy a data set for further analysis. 

The data set is [described here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#) and can be downloaded there as well.

The script performs the following actions:  
1. Downloads source data set.  
2. Creates a training and test data set.  
3. Merges training and test into one data set.  
4. Extracts the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
5. Renames variables descriptively.  
6. Creates a second data with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.

Changes Required to the Script

In the script, you will need to set the working directory to the local directory where you have saved the source data.
